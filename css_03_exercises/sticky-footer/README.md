##Exercise - Sticky Footer

##Description
Creating a sticky footer has always been a tricky task. 
Flexbox provides an elegant solution to this problem.


Aim of this exercise is to create a sticky footer which :-
* Sticks to bottom of the page when the site content is less than height of the page. 
* Comes immediately after the site content if it's height is more than the height of the page.

The page also contains a checkbox to expand the site content so that it's easy to reproduce the scenario where site content is more than the page height.
