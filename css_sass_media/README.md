## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge is to build the Coming Soon website and make it look as close as possible to the proposed design.

You can use any tool you want to complete the challenge. If you have something you would like to practice, feel free to do so.

Users should be able to:

- See the optimal layout of the website depending on the size of the device.
- View the hover states for each interactive element
- Load their email address using an `input` cmapo
- See an error message when the `form` is submited if:
	- `input` is empty. The message for this error should be *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email "*
	- The email address is not in the correct format (for example `nombre@google.com`). The message for this error should be *"Please provide a valid email address "*.

## Where to find everything

The challenge task is to build the website with the designs inside the `/design` folder. Inside you will find both mobile and desktop versions to work with.

The designs are static JPG files. This means that you will have to use your criteria for styles like `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacing and size.

You will find all the necessary assets in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which has the information you will need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the project

Feel free to use whatever workflow you are comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but don't feel you have to follow these steps:

Initialize the project as a public repository on [GitHub] (https://github.com/).
This will make it easier to share the code if you need help.
2. Set up your repository to publish your code to a URL. 
This will also be useful if you need help during a challenge, as you can share the URL of the project.
There are several ways to do this, but we recommend using [ZEIT Now] (http://bit.ly/fem-zeit). 
We have more information on how to upload the project with ZEIT below.
Look at the designs to start planning how to approach the project.
This step is crucial to help you think ahead about the CSS classes you might create to make styles reusable.
4. Before adding any styling, structure the content with HTML. Writing the HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. I wrote the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles at the top of the page and work your way down. Move on to the next section only when you are sure you have completed the area you are working on.

**Have fun programming!
