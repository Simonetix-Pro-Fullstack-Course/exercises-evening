## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge is to build the Coming Soon website and make it look as close to the proposed design as possible.

You can use any tool you want to complete the challenge. If you have something you would like to practice, feel free to do so.

Users should be able to:

- See the optimal layout of the website depending on the size of the device.
- See the hover states for each interactive element

## Where to find everything

The challenge task is to build the website with the designs inside the `/design` folder. Inside you will find both mobile and desktop versions to work with.

The designs are static JPG files. This means that you will have to use your criteria for styles like `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacing and size.

You will find all the necessary assets in the `/images` folder.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which has the information you will need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using [ZEIT Now](http://bit.ly/fem-zeit). We've got more information about deploying your project with ZEIT below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
